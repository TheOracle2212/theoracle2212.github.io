##About me
I'm not going to say too much - purely in the interest of privacy and to prevent doxxing. 

I'm 17 years old and I live on an island - a very big one (Australia). My many interest include everything from Programming (Machine learning, data science, computer vision, general systems, and embedded systems - more later), to 3D Printing, Cryptography, Mathematics (see Mathematics Posts), new and emerging technologies, Electronics - micro controller/processor systems.

A self-professed Apple fanboy; I still critque many of their decisions constructively in the intrest of iteration and development. I use MacOS and Linux for pretty much everything. 

Always looking for self-improvement ideas (or other improvement ideas), and feedback is always welcome.

See you around!
