## Ortholinear!!
Keyboards have been the same for a century and a half now. They've got the same QWERTY style letters with each row being *just* slightly misaligned from each other. Given the role of computing in our lives, and its
neccessary preeminence, very few of us have stopped to think: Why?

As it turns out, there's a very legacy-like reason. 
Before computers, we had typewriters
(Early typewriter!)[https://image.invaluable.com/housePhotos/Lawsons/05/733505/H0669-L305593279_original.jpg]
And the arms with ink that strike the page were mechanically fixed to the keys. So pressing a key caused an arm to press a thin layer of ink in the shape of a key on the paper. Neat!
