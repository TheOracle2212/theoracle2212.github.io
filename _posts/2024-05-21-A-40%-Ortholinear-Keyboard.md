## Ortholinear?!
Keyboards have been the same for a century and a half now. They've got the same QWERTY style letters with each row being *just* slightly staggered from each other. Given the
preeminence of computers, very few of us have stopped to think: Why?

As it turns out, there's a very legacy-like reason. 
Before computers, we had typewriters:

(Early typewriter!)[https://image.invaluable.com/housePhotos/Lawsons/05/733505/H0669-L305593279_original.jpg]

And the arms with ink that strike the page were mechanically fixed to the keys. So pressing a key caused an arm to press a thin layer of ink in the shape of a key on the paper. Neat! Since the arms couldn't be directly
one one another (from one key on the keypad above another), the typewriter keypad layouts were slightly shifted. All the arms could very nicely fit without any additional mechanical work. As the masses began to learn to type
on those typewriters, people simply accepted this layout. To be fair, we've reached exceptional speeds on a keyboard at speeds of above 300 words per minute - see Kurt Knutsson (I max out at a certain 103 words per minute on my Macbook Pro).
However, the nature of nature is that we must evolve. We've done well as a race using the standard staggered QWERTY keyboard layout to reach decent levels of productivity, set some records and given Carpal Tunnel to ~ 4% of the adult population. 
As an evolution, we must look back at the shape of the hand. Excersise your right (or left) pointer finger. Note its completely 1 dimensional and vertical motion. Why then, is our keyboard built for diagonal finger motion?

## Enter the ortholinear keyboard
A grid is the completely natural next step. Aesthetically it looks better, and they allow the finger to travel completely naturally. We shouldn't have to adapt for poor design. Good design should adapt to us. 
Ignoring the layout of the keyboard (QWERTY, Dvorak and such), the ortholinear keyboard should be installed by default on all Laptops and our current keyboards should use a grid layout tommorow morning! However, the issue becomes extremely
clear - convincing and retraining the masses to use another keyboard in search of supposed efficiency will never work. At the very least, I can use an ortholinear keyboard, and convince other parties to use one as well (hard given 
their rarity and price).

## Let's build it!
I've wanted to build a keyboard for years, but I just couldn't find the right excuse. However, after learning about this supposed efficency, I decided that this and my spare Raspberry Pi Pico would suffice and I gathered the parts. 
Building a keyboard is mostly straightforward, but I wanted to do it with the parts on hand, and fairly quickly. With me was 55 keyswitches so I made the choice of an extremely small 40% keyboard. However, my Ultimaker had only enough bed space
for a 40% keyboard.

The next post will hopefully be my actual building guide. See you soon!
