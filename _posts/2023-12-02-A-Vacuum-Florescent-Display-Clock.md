I was given a Vacuum fluorescent display (VFD) for the primary purpose of making a clock. To do so, I decided to add a GPS for accurate time (and date) and better still, latitude and longitude. With these, I could technically turn the clock on anywhere in the world, give it a couple of seconds and let it show me the time accurate to the timezone. Just like that! Better still, with a built in battery, it should run for a couple of days, providing Real Time Clock (RTC) level timekeeping, waiting to recieve accurate time again. However, the one Waveshare NEO M6N I had didn't have a battery.
