"   "Hi!

<p>This is my blog, where's I'll regularly post what's happening on my messy desk.</p>

<p>I'll do everything for electronics to programming projects in my spare time between studying.</p>



<ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
      <span class="post-date">{{ post.date | date: "%B %d, %Y" }}</span>
      <p>{{ post.content | strip_html | truncatewords: 75 }}</p>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
